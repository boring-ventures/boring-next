description: Prevent critical structural conflicts and enforce change tracking inside Quantum CRM
globs: [src//*.{tsx,ts,js,jsx}, prisma/schema.prisma]
alwaysApply: true

- Before modifying any entity structure (Lead, Company, Product, etc.), analyze related files: types, hooks, API routes, components
- If modifying prisma/schema.prisma, always regenerate Prisma Client and update corresponding types in src/types
- Avoid breaking existing API routes; use additive changes (e.g., add new fields rather than deleting existing ones)
- Always maintain backward compatibility unless a complete migration is explicitly planned
- Validate major functionality with local testing before pushing or saving changes
- Record every meaningful change (field added, model modified, API updated) into a centralized changelog file located at /CHANGELOG-QUANTUM.txt
- Changelog entry format:
  - [Date] [Type: Feature, Fix, Refactor, Schema] - [Brief Description] - [Author initials]
  - Example: [2025-04-25] [Feature] - Added leadPriority field to Lead model - [AB]
- Append to CHANGELOG-QUANTUM.txt at each commit or major Cursor action, do not overwrite
- If structural conflicts are detected, prioritize rollback to last known stable structure before applying new changes
- In case of schema change, include Prisma migration file name reference in the changelog entry
- Ensure Prisma migrations are committed sequentially and clearly named (e.g., "20250425-add-lead-priority-field")
